# OPlist - The Programmer's Search Engine

> This project sprung up as an idea - just like you would expect, though not in that fashion you are thinking of right now. The purpose, initially, was to understand how search engines work. But I suddenly lost interest in the mechanism of their operations, because it is an ancient and vast world and I am a relatively modern and knowledge-deficient programmer. Then **modesty** decides I offer this a gift to programmers...though not a perfect gift as some almost-perfect programmer's search engines out there. Don't be misled by the last sentence; this does its job and does it well, though _"flaws and flaws make a predefined flawless software a beautiful flaw._
